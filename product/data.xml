<!--
  **This is your product or game page**. It should focus on _ONLY_ one product. This is not a replacement for your product's website, but a quick way for the press to know it faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/product/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t product
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  <hr>

  For your company' `data.xml`, [refer to the company documentation](../company/).

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->

  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.


    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:

    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```

    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.

    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:

    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```

    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._

    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    Program your Mech with cards in this turn-based roguelike. You will be dispatched on diverse missions across various planets. Each mission will require you to program your Mech accordingly in order to succeed.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.

    You can't have both.

    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.
  -->
  <history>
	The game idea is inspired by the board game Mech vs. Minions by Riot Games. The board game creates a wonderful co-op experience best described as 'chaotic fun'. Lacking a true single player experience, Alexander imagined what the gameplay would be like if packaged as a digital single player roguelike. This led to the first prototype created by him in 2019.		
	Although the game design and programming was coming along nicely, the art definitely was not. In an effort to improve the visual appeal of the game, Alexander reached out to artists interested in joining the project. Harry quickly responded and joined the project in 2020. He reworked all art assets and significantly improved the visual appeal of the game.
	
	Constant feedback from players has been a core design pillar throughout the development of the game. This made Early Access a clear choice as development of the game moved forward.

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.
